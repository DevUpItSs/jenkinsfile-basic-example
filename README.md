# Basic Jenkinsfile Example

This project contains a basic example of a `Jenkinsfile` for CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins.

## 🧱 Pipeline Stages

1. **Clone Repo** – Simulates pulling the code from a Git repository.
2. **Build** – A placeholder for building your application.
3. **Test** – Run automated tests (e.g., unit tests).
4. **Deploy** – Deploy the built application (e.g., to staging or production).

## 🧪 How to Use

- Add this `Jenkinsfile` to the root of your repository.
- Set up a Jenkins pipeline project pointing to the repo.
- Make sure Jenkins has the necessary build tools and permissions.

## 📁 Files

- `Jenkinsfile` – Contains all pipeline stages and example shell commands.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Understand the structure of a Jenkins declarative pipeline
- Explore how CI/CD flows typically work
